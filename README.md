# JavaScript Loose and Strict Equality Comparisons

This repository demonstrates unexpected behavior in JavaScript's loose (==) and strict (===) equality operators when comparing special values such as NaN, -0, and undefined.

## The Bug

JavaScript's loose equality operator (==) performs type coercion before comparison, leading to counterintuitive results. The strict equality operator (===) avoids type coercion, but still has quirks related to NaN and -0.

The provided JavaScript code (`bug.js`) illustrates this behavior using the `foo` function.

## The Solution

The solution (`bugSolution.js`) emphasizes the use of `Object.is()` for more reliable comparisons, addressing the inconsistencies of `==` and `===`. `Object.is()` offers a more precise and predictable equality check, especially when dealing with special values.
